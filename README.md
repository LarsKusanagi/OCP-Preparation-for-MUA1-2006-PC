This project is for a preparation on which files to be included or excluded in the Official Characters Pack and Expanded Game Edition of Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, including for cut content. It has two separate branches:
* One (Main) is for the released files which are ready to be playable in the game
* Another is for sourced files (such as custom mesh mod model sourcess, and preview of model (reskin and mesh mod) and hud images).
